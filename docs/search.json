    "text": "Andrew M. Demetriou\n Email\n LinkedIn\n Scholar\n GitHub\n ORCID\n\n\n\nA Social Data Scientist\n\nI bring together the social, data, measurement, and computer sciences. My value stems from (1) diverse knowledge about how to design, collect, and analyze data, with (2) experience designing, managing, and delivering on projects in both industry and academia, and (3) finding clear ways to communicate results to diverse stakeholders.\nI think a lot about how we use data to learn things and make decisions. This is why I like to study measurement - the way different scientific fields translate things that happen in the real world into numbers they analyze to learn and decide. This had led me to delivering data using a broad range of tools - VR-based field studies, hormones from hair and saliva samples, psychometric questionnaires, electro-cardiac measures using the consumer and research grade devices, as well as digital traces and key performance indicators from smartphone apps. I‚Äôve also delivered analysis results using a number of techniques (e.g.¬†Robust Rank Aggregation, Linear Mixed Effects Models, Specification Curve Analyses), in a range of fields, which include experimental Psychology and Criminology, and in Ground-Truthing - the science of gathering the data used to evaluate AI systems, as well as in industry and non-profit settings, to diverse stakeholders. My experience has shown me that tools from various fields and settings can be used to better learn and make decisions using data.\nDuring my PhD, I applied this thinking to studying AI. I looked at how to improve the way we gather the measurements that we use to evaluate AI systems - often called the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù or the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù. We train and evaluate AI systems with data, and we often collect the evaluation data from people. Scholars have published works pointing out key issues with the data used for training and evaluating AI systems. For my PhD, I tried to bring in knowledge from the social sciences to improve ground truth by improving how we gather it from people. Thinking as a social Scientist, the field uses validated methods so that the data from people can be used as measurements.\nMy PhD thesis aimed to understand how to design, collect, and analyze ground truth, in challenging situations where there is no single truth, but rather multiple perspectives. It also informs generally how to ‚Äúground‚Äù psychological phenomena in text. The case study of my thesis involved measuring the basic values in song lyrics and political speeches. I brought knowledge from the Social Sciences, particularly psychometrics, to inform how to go about the process of ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù as a Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems PhD candidate in the Intelligent Systems department at Delft University of Technology, in the lab of Cynthia C. S. Liem.\nI‚Äôm now looking to build on my experiences in a way that benefits as many people as possible.

    "text": "Most widely consumed music in Western countries includes song lyrics, with US samples indicating that nearly all personal song libraries contain lyrics. Social science theory suggests that personal values expressed in widely consumed text, like song lyrics, may align with or diverge from those of the listener, potentially shaping their response to the music. This highlights the potential of automated value estimation in lyrics for downstream music information retrieval (MIR) tasks, like personalization. Like prior work, we adopt a perspectivist approach informed by social science theory to reliably collect annotations and assess their quality. We then use a novel approach to automatically estimate values in song lyrics using large language models (LLMs), combined with programmatic prompt optimizer DSPy, gathering multiple estimates from each LLM to estimate intra-model reliability. We then compare aggregated human ratings with aggregated ratings from a subset of the most reliable LLMs, showing promising initial results. At the same time, in response to concerns about the energy footprint of LLMs, we monitor energy usage. We conclude that the results are a positive step forward in terms of estimating values in lyrics, but open challenges remain on the side of reliability and power requirements."
