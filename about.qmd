### Shaping AI with <span class="highlight">Measurement</span>

I think of AI system evaluations as measurements. The more precise the measurement, the better we can align AI systems it.I think of the data that we use to evaluate AI systems - often called the "gold standard" or the "ground truth" - as a measurement problem, and pursuit of useful ways to measure AI systems as a key challenge. I try to bring in knowledge from my experience of the way other fields measure - VR-based field studies, hormones from hair and saliva samples, psychometric questionnaires, electro-cardiac measures using the VU-DAMS, in Psychology in Criminology, in academia and industry - to improve how we evaluate AI. 

My PhD thesis aimed to understand how to design, collect, and analyze ground truth, in challenging situations where there is no single truth, but rather multiple perspectives. It also informs generally how to "ground" psychological phenomena in text. The case study of my thesis involved measuring the [basic values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_basic_human_values#:~:text=Schwartz%20identifies%20ten%20basic%20human,and%20the%20Portrait%20Values%20Questionnaire.) in song lyrics and political speeches. I brought knowledge from the Social Sciences, particularly [psychometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics), to inform how to go about the process of "grounding" as a Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems PhD candidate in the Intelligent Systems department at Delft University of Technology, in the lab of [Cynthia C. S. Liem](https://www.cynthialiem.com/). 

I'm now looking to build on my experiences in a way that benefits as many people as possible. Download my [CV ](CV/cv.pdf) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-m-demetriou/){target=_blank}.
